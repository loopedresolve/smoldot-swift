## Smoldot Swift

A Swift wrapper for the [smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot) Rust-based  Polkadot light client.


## Installation

Add the package declaration to your project's manifest dependencies array:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/finsig/smoldot-swift.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

## Usage

A Chain Specification file must be provided to initialize a chain. A Chain Specification is a JSON Object that describes a Polkadot-based blockchain network. 

*Example Chain Specification JSON files for Polkadot, Kusama, Rococo, and Westend can be copied for use from [/Tests/SmoldotSwiftTests/Resources](https://github.com/loopedresolve/smoldot-swift/tree/main/Tests/SmoldotSwiftTests/Resources).*


Initialize a chain from a specification file:

```swift
var chain = Chain(specificationFile: {Resource file URL})
```

Add the chain to the client to connect to the network:

```swift
try Client.shared.add(chain: &chain)
```


RPC requests must conform to the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. A request can be built programatically:

```swift
let request = try JSONRPC2Request(method: "chain_getHeader", identifier: .int(1))
```

or initialized from a String in the JSON data format:

```swift
let request = try JSONRPC2Request(string: "{\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"chain_getHeader\",\"params\":[]}")
```
To send the request use:

```swift
try Client.shared.send(request: request, to: chain)
```

To wait for a response use:

```swift
try await Client.shared.response(from: chain)
```

Alternatively, an asynchronous stream of responses may be read using:

```swift
try await Client.shared.responses(from: chain)
```

To disconnect the client from the network use:

```swift
try Client.shared.remove(chain: &chain)
````


For additional information about usage see [reference documentation](https://finsig.github.io/smoldot-swift/documentation/smoldotswift/).

## Logging

You may enable logging of the smoldot Rust FFI library with an environment variable at runtime (`RUST_LOG`). The library uses the Rust`env_logger` framework and levels can be set accordingly.

## Building locally

There is a build_xcframework.sh script in the repo which can be used to build the XCode Framework target from the smoldot Rust FFI library. 

```zsh
$ zsh build_xcframework.sh dev
```

Omitting the `dev` argument will modify the package settings to use a remote binary target and create a compressed framework file (along with the checksum value).


## Testing

In addition to unit tests please see this [project](https://github.com/finsig/smoldot-swift-performance) for memory usage profiling.

## Bug Reports

See [GitHub issues](https://github.com/finsig/smoldot-swift/issues) regarding log noise.
